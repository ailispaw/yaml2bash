# Add groups to the system
# The following example adds the ubuntu group with members foo and bar and
# the group cloud-users.
groups:
  - ubuntu: [foo,bar]
  - cloud-users

# Add users to the system. Users are added after groups are added.
users:
  - default
  - name: foobar
    gecos: Foo B. Bar
    primary-group: foobar
    groups: users
    selinux-user: staff_u
    expiredate: 2012-09-01
    ssh-import-id: foobar
    lock_passwd: false
    passwd: $6$j212wezy$7H/1LT4f9/N3wpgNunhsIqtMj62OKiS3nyNwuizouQc3u7MbYCarYeAHWYPYb2FT.lbioDm2RrkJPb9BZMN1O/

# Valid Values:
#   name: The user's login name
#   gecos: The user name's real name, i.e. "Bob B. Smith"
#   homedir: Optional. Set to the local path you want to use. Defaults to
#           /home/<username>
#   primary-group: define the primary group. Defaults to a new group created
#           named after the user.
#   groups:  Optional. Additional groups to add the user to. Defaults to none
#   selinux-user:  Optional. The SELinux user for the user's login, such as
#           "staff_u". When this is omitted the system will select the default
#           SELinux user.
#   lock_passwd: Defaults to true. Lock the password to disable password login
#   inactive: Create the user as inactive
#   passwd: The hash -- not the password itself -- of the password you want
#           to use for this user. You can generate a safe hash via:
#               mkpasswd --method=SHA-512 --rounds=4096
#           (the above command would create from stdin an SHA-512 password hash
#           with 4096 salt rounds)
#
#           Please note: while the use of a hashed password is better than
#               plain text, the use of this feature is not ideal. Also,
#               using a high number of salting rounds will help, but it should
#               not be relied upon.
#
#               To highlight this risk, running John the Ripper against the
#               example hash above, with a readily available wordlist, revealed
#               the true password in 12 seconds on a i7-2620QM.
#
#               In other words, this feature is a potential security risk and is
#               provided for your convenience only. If you do not fully trust the
#               medium over which your cloud-config will be transmitted, then you
#               should use SSH authentication only.
#
#               You have thus been warned.
#   no-create-home: When set to true, do not create home directory.
#   no-user-group: When set to true, do not create a group named after the user.
#   no-log-init: When set to true, do not initialize lastlog and faillog database.
#   ssh-import-id: Optional. Import SSH ids
#   ssh-authorized-keys: Optional. [list] Add keys to user's authorized keys file
#   sudo: Defaults to none. Set to the sudo string you want to use, i.e.
#           ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL. To add multiple rules, use the following
#           format.
#               sudo:
#                   - ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/bin/mysql
#                   - ALL=(ALL) ALL
#           Note: Please double check your syntax and make sure it is valid.
#               cloud-init does not parse/check the syntax of the sudo
#               directive.
#   system: Create the user as a system user. This means no home directory.
#   snapuser: Create a Snappy (Ubuntu-Core) user via the snap create-user
#             command available on Ubuntu systems.  If the user has an account
#             on the Ubuntu SSO, specifying the email will allow snap to
#             request a username and any public ssh keys and will import
#             these into the system with username specifed by SSO account.
#             If 'username' is not set in SSO, then username will be the
#             shortname before the email domain.
#

# Default user creation:
#
# Unless you define users, you will get a 'ubuntu' user on ubuntu systems with the
# legacy permission (no password sudo, locked user, etc). If however, you want
# to have the 'ubuntu' user in addition to other users, you need to instruct
# cloud-init that you also want the default user. To do this use the following
# syntax:
#    users:
#      - default
#      - bob
#      - ....
#  foobar: ...
#
# users[0] (the first user in users) overrides the user directive.
#
# The 'default' user above references the distro's config:
# system_info:
#   default_user:
#    name: Ubuntu
#    plain_text_passwd: 'ubuntu'
#    home: /home/ubuntu
#    shell: /bin/bash
#    lock_passwd: True
#    gecos: Ubuntu
#    groups: [adm, audio, cdrom, dialout, floppy, video, plugdev, dip, netdev]
